# JavaScript

    will be doing some javascript lately.
    i know i'm late but hey i actually started :)


    C'ya ...

## topics :

    1. variables
    2. functions ( and types )
    3. string concatination -> ${magic}
    4. if else conditionals
    5. Array
    6. Object and This
    7. loop
    8. DOM manipulation

## note: 
    
    1. == can be used to check for equality, but we use === to strict typeCheck to ensure that type and value, both are same.
    2. this refers to window object.
